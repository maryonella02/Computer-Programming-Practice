# Computer-Programming-Practice
This repository contains mostly all programs I develop during Computer Programming course. 

Every folder contains a file with programs' description or title. Every program's name corresponds with title/description in Items file.
I added only source code of programs. 

I admit that not all algorithms are developed by me. I inspired on World Wide Web, but I modified them according to my teacher requirements.
